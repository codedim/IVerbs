**IVerbs** is a web-based application that was initially intended to help somebody 
who learn English to get through the commonly used **irregular verbs**.
	
Let's talk about the English language a bit, before we have started with it. 
So, why do many people learn English for? What might this learning bring for the 
foreign-language people?

Someone says, English needs me to get a new job or promotion. The other one always 
wish traveling without any language barriers. The best answer, I believe, is to get 
the great opportunity to interact with the most large and popular social environment 
in the World. And to be in touch with the mainstream is the best reason for that 
motivation, I think.

But, what do you have to do, as a beginner, to get a certain success with yours 
English learning? There are a few common classic steps to do that, which as follow

* learn the basic grammar structures and make them use without difficulty;
* by the way, memorize a couple of thousand of the most commonly used words;
* always work at your pronunciation, especially with unfamiliar vowels and 
consonants.

With these skills you will be able to compose quite a lot of English sentences and 
somehow communicate with an English-speaking person. But, can you understand his or 
her well? The answer is still No.

Well, do not give up, because you are an intermediate-level learner now. And what 
are you going to do on this level? The answer is practice, practice and practice. 
You should have to manage with following things

* reading -- the text understanding;
* writing -- how a lot of words must be written to;
* listening -- understanding of the fluent speech;
* talking -- the ability to talk in a fluent maner.

Those things are not so easy as well. But, there is an advice to get these skills 
well. You should abandon the use of your own language as much as possible! The 
best way to do that is the moving in an Englisk-speaking country and living there 
for a couple of years. But to put it mildly, this way is not fit for everybody.

So, how can we achieve an immersion in the forain language without leaving from 
our country? We should probably use our computers and mobile devices to get it. 
This is the really simplest way in present time, so the Internet and Youtube will 
help us with that.

For example, you might to download some English books on your mobile device and 
read them when you have time. The best experience for beginners will bring the 
reading by Ilya Frank's method. 

In that method a book contains original English stories, which have each paragraph 
repeated twice. The first is interspersed with literal translations of words and 
phrases, with their actual meanings if needed. And the second one is unmodified 
original version.

In such a way you will be able to improve your reading skills and quickly increase 
your vocabulary. So, what about the writing? Well, you may write something in a 
text editor with spell-checking feature. 

And it's okay with that, but correspondence with real English-speaking people 
gives more better results. Well, you can visit some English forum or social network 
to get this ability; or even try to find a pen-friend. If you think that it is not 
so easy, just think about that -- people need to communicate each other everywhere 
and the Internet makes this possibility much wider.

Okay, we have got reading and writing methods now. What about the understanding 
of the fluent native speech? Ohh, this skill is not so easy to improve actually. 
And we are going to manage with a great job. 

But firstly, ask yourself -- how many words you don't know when you are reading 
the common English text? If your answer will be -- It's about two or three words 
within ten make me look into the dictionary -- go ahead. If not, you should go 
back to this step next time.

Yeah, the answer is yes and what are we gonna do? In fact, you're going to get 
the ability to recognize practically each word in a fluent foreign speech. And 
that is not easy, because most likely the native speakers will not give odds to 
you. As well as all of them have different manners to speak and so on. 

But there is nothing impossible for motivated person. And as the first step, try 
to watch your favorite English movie without any translation. 

> Note that if you are watching the movie with subtitles, you are just going to 
improve your reading skill, because your mind will choose the most easiest way to 
manage with the task.

After that, you should estimate your ability to recognize the words in actors' 
dialogues. So, if you have been able to separate those words from each other -- 
including unknown words as well -- it's completely nice. But if most of the movie 
you have heard something like blah-blah-blah -- you need a deep dive into this 
process.

How does the deep dive look like? You should cancel all your plans at the weekend 
to be able to watch as many English movies as you can. After many hours of the 
watching you will feel as you have been starting to gain that skill.

> Just remember, you have not to make the efforts to translate those phrases. 
Because you goal on this step is to get the ability of recognizing the words, 
they are consist of.
