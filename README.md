**IVerbs** is a web-based application that was initially intended to help somebody 
who learn English to get through the commonly used **irregular verbs**. But,..
	
Let me discourse about the English language generally, before you proceed with 
it. Why do many people learn English for? What might this studing bring to a 
foreign-language person?

Someone says, English needs me to get a new job or promotion. The other one always 
wish traveling without any language barriers. The best answer, I believe, is to get 
the great opportunity to interact with the most large and popular social environment 
in the World. And to be just in touch with the mainstream is the best reason for that 
motivation, I think.

But, what do you have to do, as a beginner, to get a certain success with yours 
English learning? There are a few common classic steps to do that, which as follow

* learn the basic grammar structures and make them use without difficulty;
* by the way, memorize a couple of thousand of the most commonly used words;
* work at your pronunciation, especially under unfamiliar vowel and consonant 
sounds. 

> Note. If you want to become a fluent English speaker and listener in the future, 
it is very very important to work at the pronunciation right from the start.

With these skills you will be able to compose quite a lot of English sentences and 
somehow communicate with English-speaking people. But, will you understand them 
well? The answer is still No.

So, do not give up, because you are an intermediate-level learner now. And what 
are you going to do on this level? The answer is practice, practice and practice. 
You are going to be able to manage with following things

* reading -- the complicated text understanding ability;
* writing -- knowledge of which way many words must be spelled;
* listening -- well understanding of the fluent speech;
* speaking -- the skill to speak in a fluent manner as well.

Those things are not so easy to learn actually. But, I have is a small advice for 
you about, how to get those skills more quickly. Here it is. You should reduce the 
influence on these processes of your native language as much as possible! 

The best way for it is the removal into an English-speaking country and living 
there for a couple of years. But, to put it mildly, this way is not to be accepted 
by everybody.

But, how can we achieve the immersion in the forain language without leaving from 
our country? We should probably use our computers and mobile devices to get it. 
This is the really simplest way in present time, so the Internet and Google services 
will help us with that.

For example, you might to download some English books on your mobile device and 
read them when you have time. The best experience for beginners will bring the 
reading by Ilya Frank's method. 

In that method a book contains original English stories, which have each paragraph 
repeated twice. The first is interspersed with literal translations of words and 
phrases, with their actual meanings if needed. And the second one is unmodified 
original version.

In such a way you will be able to improve your reading skills and quickly increase 
your vocabulary. So, what about the writing? Well, you may write something in a 
text editor with spell-checking feature, for example. 

And it's okay with that, but correspondence with real English-speaking person will 
give you more better results. You should visit some English forums or social networks 
to get this opportunity, or even try to find an English pen-friend. If you think it 
is not so easy, just figure out -- people need to communicate each other everywhere 
and the Internet makes this possibility much wider.

Okay, we have got reading and writing skills now. What about the understanding 
of the fluent native speech? Ohh, this skill is not so easy to improve actually. 
And we are going to do a great job. 

But firstly, ask yourself -- how many words don't you know when you are reading 
the common English text? If your answer will be -- It's about two or three words 
within ten make me look into the dictionary -- go ahead. If not, you should go 
back to this step next time.

Yeah, the answer is yes and what are we gonna do now? In fact, you're about to 
get the ability to recognize practically each word in a fluent foreign speech. And 
that is not a peace of cake, because most likely the native speakers will not give 
you odds. As well as, all of them have different manners to speak: speech speed, 
acñent, lexicon, slang and so on. 

But there is nothing impossible for motivated person. Isn't it? So, as the first step, 
just try to watch your favorite English movie without any translation. 

> Note that if you are watching the movie with subtitles, you are about to improve 
your reading skill, because your mind will choose the most easiest way to manage 
with the task.

After that, you should estimate your ability to recognize the words in actors' 
dialogues. So, if you have been able to separate those words from each other -- 
including unknown words as well -- it's completely nice. But if most of the movie 
you have heard something like blah-blah-blah -- you need a deep dive into this 
process.

How does the deep dive look like? You should cancel all your next weekend plans 
to be able to watch as many English movies as you can. After many hours of the 
watching you will feel as you have been starting to gain that skill.

> Just remember, you have not to make too much efforts to translate those phrases. 
Because your goal on this step is to get the ability of recognizing the words, they 
are consist of.
