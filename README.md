English learning
----------------
	
But before you proceed with it, let's discuss about the English language generally. 
Why do so many people learn English? What might this studying bring a foreign-language 
person?

Someone might say, I need English to get a new job or promotion. Another always wishes 
to travel without any language barriers. I believe, the best answer to this question 
is that study of English achieves the greatest opportunity to interact with the largest 
and most popular social environment in the World. And to be just in touch with the 
mainstream is the best reason for motivation.

### Beginner level

What do you have to do, as a beginner, to get a certain success with your English 
learning? There are a few common classic steps to do that, which are as follows

* learn the basic grammar structures and make use of them without difficulty;
* by the way, memorize a couple of thousand of the most commonly used words;
* work at your pronunciation, especially the unfamiliar vowel and consonant sounds. 

> Note. If you want to become a fluent English speaker and listener in the future, 
it is very very important to work at the pronunciation right from the beginning.

Look at the basic grammar structures in the language you have to master, once you 
have started to learn English. But firstly, let's make some agreements to mark 
the **interrogative**, **affirmative** and **negative** statements with the **(?)**, 
**(+)** and **(-)** conventions -- and **future**, **present**, **past** tenses with 
the **>[...]>**, **>[...]<**, **<[...]<** conventions accordingly. Okay, go ahead.

            | (?) | (+) | (-)
------------|-----|-----|-----
**>[...]>** | **Will** *I, you, he, she, it, we, they* like. | *I, you, he, she, it, we, they* **will** like. | *I, you, he, she, it, we, they* **will not** like.
**>[...]<** | **Do** *I, you, we, are, they* like. **Does** *he, she, it* like. | *I, you, we, they* like. *He, she, it* like**s**. | *I, you, we, they* **do not** like. *He, she, it* **does not** like.
**<[...]<** | **Did** *I, you, he, she, it, we, they* like. | *I, you, he, she, it, we, they* lik**ed**. | *I, you, he, she, it, we, they* **did not** like.


With these skills you will be able to compose quite a lot of English sentences and 
somehow communicate with English-speaking people. But, will you understand them 
well? The answer is still No.

### Intermediate level

So, do not give up, because you are an intermediate-level learner now. And what 
are you going to do at this level? The answer is practice, practice and practice. 
You are going to be able to manage the following things

* reading -- the ability to understand complicated text;
* writing -- knowledge of which way many words must be spelled;
* listening -- good understanding of fluent speech;
* speaking -- the skill to speak in a fluent manner as well.

Those things are not so easy to learn actually. But I have a little advice for you 
about how to get those skills more quickly and efficiently. Here it is. You should 
reduce the influence on these processes from your native language as much as possible! 

The best way for it is the removal into an English-speaking country and living there 
for a couple of years. But, to put it mildly, this way is not accepted by everybody.

But how can we achieve immersion in the foreign language without leaving our country? 
We should probably use our computers and mobile devices to get it. This is really the 
simplest way at the present time, so the Internet and Google's services will help us 
with that.

For example, you might download some English books on your mobile device and read 
them when you have time. The best experience for beginners will bring the reading by 
Ilya Frank's method. 

In that method a book contains original English stories, which have each paragraph 
repeated twice. The first is interspersed with literal translations of words and 
phrases, with their actual meanings if needed. And the second one is unmodified 
original version.

In such a way you will be able to improve your reading skills and quickly increase 
your vocabulary. So, what about writing? Well, you may write something in a text editor 
with spell-checking feature, for example. 

And it's okay doing that, but correspondence with real English-speaking person will 
give you better results. You should visit some English forums or social networks to get 
this opportunity, or even try to find an English pen-friend. If you think it is not so 
easy, just figure out this -- people need to communicate each other everywhere and the 
Internet makes this possibility much wider.

Okay, we have got reading and writing skills now. What about the understanding of 
fluent native speech? Ohh, this skill is not so easy to improve actually. And we are 
going to do a great job. 

But firstly, ask yourself -- how many words don't you know when you are reading common 
English text? If your answer will be -- It's about two or three words in ten makeing me 
look in the dictionary -- go ahead. If not, you should go back to this step next time.

Yeah, if the answer is yes what are we going to do now? In fact, you're about to get 
the ability to recognize practically each word in fluent foreign speech. And that is not 
a peace of cake, because most likely the native speakers will not give you odds. As well 
as, all of them have different manners to speak: speech speed, accent, lexicon, slang and 
so on. 

But nothing is impossible for a motivated person. Is it? So, as the first step, just try 
to watch your favorite English movie without any translation. 

> Note that if you are watching the movie with subtitles, you are about to improve 
your reading skill, because your mind will choose the most easiest way to manage 
with the task.

After that, you should estimate your ability to recognize the words in actors' 
dialogues. So, if you have been able to separate those words from each other -- 
including unknown words as well -- it's completely nice. But if most of the movie 
you have heard something like blah-blah-blah -- you need to take a deep dive into this 
process.

What does a deep dive look like? You should cancel all your next weekend plans to be 
able to watch as many English movies as you can. After many hours of the watching you 
will feel as you have been starting to gain that skill.

> Just remember, you do not have to make too many efforts to translate those phrases. 
Because your goal at this step is to get the ability of recognizing words, what they 
consist of.
